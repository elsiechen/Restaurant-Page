## Technologies Used
- HTML

## Features
- Use webpack to organize and bundle modules including dependencies, image and font assets into optimized files  
that can be efficiently loaded by web browsers.
- Use ES6 Modules to organize code into separate files to make it easier to maintain and reuse code within project.
- Use Prettier package to format the output index.html file that webpack left all tags in one line which lose code readability.
